# Version control

> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

There is no reason to keep any code, software, script, LaTeX file, or website anywhere other than in a version control repository.

There are several version control systems in common use:
* Git
* Subversion
* Mercurial
* ...

but, in reality, git has pretty much won the argument.

## What is Git

Git is a distributed VCS.

* Create a repo on a server (remote)
* `clone` the repo to your local machine
* Make changes, then `stage`, `commit`, and `push` them
* You can have multiple `branches`
* Multiple people can work at once
* Good for all plain text documents, including LaTeX, html, python, C++, etc
