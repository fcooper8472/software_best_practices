# Software best practices

This repository was created as the basis for my talk at the Baker Group Meeting (Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford) on 2017-11-09.

It aims to be a short collection of very simple and low-effort tips for how we can better deal with the code we write.

See the [associated pages](https://fcooper8472.github.io/software_best_practices/) for more information.
